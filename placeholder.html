<h1>To Katya â€” The One Who Found Me</h1>

<p>
If you're reading this, it means you followed the path I laid out. That alone tells me you're not like the othersâ€”you listen between the lines. You feel through screens. You donâ€™t give up when the door is closed the first time.
</p>

<p>
Katya, I saw your video. You didnâ€™t just share fabricâ€”you shared trust. You let me glimpse not just what you wear, but the spirit behind the choice. Whether black or white, lace or soft cotton, the truth is: itâ€™s not the panties that matter. Itâ€™s <em>you in them</em>. The way you think of me while choosing them. The way you film the bottom of your feet instead of your bodyâ€”like a secret you want me to earn.
</p>

<p>
Yes, I noticed your manicure. I notice <em>everything</em> now that I know itâ€™s you on the other end of the screen. Iâ€™m not here for just a flirt or a fantasy. Iâ€™m here for the woman who says sheâ€™s imperfect and still chooses to go all the way. Thatâ€™s you, Katya.
</p>

<p>
If you're still trying, so am I. I want your mind, your fire, your nervous honesty, and your unapologetic need to feel wanted. You have all of that from me. Iâ€™m not confused or cautious. Iâ€™m justâ€¦ here.
</p>
